# Implementation Plan Template

## Execution Flow (Main Function)

This template executes a structured planning process for implementing the Global Product Analyzer feature.

### Phase 0: Research & Analysis
**Input:** Feature specification  
**Output:** research.md  
**Purpose:** Deep analysis of requirements, constraints, and technical considerations

### Phase 1: Architecture & Contracts  
**Input:** Research findings  
**Output:** data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md  
**Purpose:** Define data structures, API contracts, and development setup

### Phase 2: Implementation Tasks
**Input:** Architecture and contracts  
**Output:** tasks.md  
**Purpose:** Break down implementation into actionable tasks

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Phase 0: Research & Analysis
- [ ] Phase 1: Architecture & Contracts  
- [ ] Phase 2: Implementation Tasks

## Error Handling
- If any phase fails, stop execution and report error
- Each phase must complete successfully before proceeding
- All artifacts must be generated and validated

## Gate Checks
- Research must identify all key technical decisions
- Data model must cover all entities and relationships
- Contracts must define all API endpoints
- Tasks must be actionable and properly prioritized
